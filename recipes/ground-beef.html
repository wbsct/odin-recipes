      One-Pan Ground Beef Stroganoff Noodles – Helping Hamburger Help Itself
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most people who grew up during the Golden Age of processed food, my
      mom bought a fair amount of pre-packaged, pre-mixed, just-add-water type
      meals, but when it came to pasta or noodles in a ground meat sauce, her
      hamburger did not need any help. We did enjoy the occasional box of mac
      and cheese, or package of pop-tarts, but virtually all dishes like this
      ground beef stroganoff noodles were made from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamburger Helper was something other moms who didn't know how to cook
      served their kids, and while that might have been a touch hypocritical,
      since she may have been making pancakes from a box while saying it, we
      were grateful. Having said all that, I've had Hamburger Helper, and didn't
      hate it, and the idea of a quick, easy, one-pan meal involving meaty sauce
      coved noodles was a great one. So, I decided to share this homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many different shapes and sizes of egg noodles, so the one and
      only challenge with this recipe is their cooking time. Please just use my
      times as a guide, and keeping cooking, stirring occasionally, adding
      liquid as needed, until the noodles are perfect. Once they are, stir in
      the sour cream, and you're eating. If you add that before everything is
      done, it may split as it simmers. Other than that, not much can go wrong,
      and I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms,
        season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn
        golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and
        crumbly, and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season
        with black pepper and cayenne.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>
        Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring
        occasionally, for 10 minutes..
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting
        lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again
        and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. (See Cook's
        Note.)
